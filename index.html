<p class="lbt">A typical day in the life of <i>Blake Hancock</i> involves getting up at 7:15AM to get to class on time. I wake up each morning and eat a nutrtitious breakfast that involves a protein shake and either cereal or toast. I then hop into the shower, get dressed, then I am off to take on the day.
Everyday, in between classes, I like to cook lunch. My lunch usually involves eggs, bacon, a banana, and some yogurt. Nothing too fancy. After lunch I rush back out the door for my next class.
</p>
<p class="tab">
After my classes end for the day, I head back to my apartment. I fix myself a small snack and head off to the gym.
It takes me anywhere from 10-20 minutes to get there depending on the traffic at the time. The gym I workout at is <A href="https://www.crunch.com/locations/athens">Crunch Fitness</A>.
I spend roughly 2.5 hours working out each day. I am constantly pushing myself to reach success and putting in a great deal of time is necessary to see results. A healthy lifestyle is the best lifestyle.
</p>
<p class="lbt">
Once I finish my workout, I head home and prepare for dinner. Most nights, I make either chicken and alfredo or spaghetti. After I eat I begin cleaning up the mess I made while cooking. Now, it's time for some homework. I spend around 2 hours doing homework and making sure I am caught up in all of my classes. Homework is my least favorite part of the day, but definitely one of the most important parts. After I spend some time on homework, I finish off the night and play Xbox with some friends. After a while, once it has gotten late, it is time for me to go to sleep so I can start the process all over again the next day.
